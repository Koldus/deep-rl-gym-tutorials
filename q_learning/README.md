# Double Deep Q-Learning

WIP. Use at your own risk!

## Atari

[`atari_train.py`](./atari_train.py) provides an example of training on a Dueling Convolutional Network with DDQN on Atari environments. Although, any environment with images as observations should be fine.

[`atari_play.py`](./atari_play.py) provides an example of loading a previously trained model and running a number of games for evaluation purposes.
